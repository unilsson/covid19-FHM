# covid19-FHM
Repository for covid19-FHM statistics from Folkhälsomyndigheten in Sweden as well as Python and R scripts to analyze the data. The data is published by [Folkhälsomyndigheten](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se) and is collected here without any changes. If the data is used for producing any material, please state the source of the data to be Folkhälsomyndigheten.

This project is not a professional tool for data analysis, but rather my own project to expand my knowledge of Python, R, and GitHub. This means that the code quality will neither be of absolute top quality or optimized in any way.
